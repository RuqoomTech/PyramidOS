# Layer 1: Strategic Roadmap (PyramidOS)

**Vision:** A sovereign, monolithic kernel engineered from scratch in C/Assembly. It delivers a user experience inspired by the intuitiveness of Windows 95, but powered by a completely custom, non-proprietary internal architecture.

## 0. 🇸🇦 Arabic-First Initiative (End-to-End)

**Goal:** Ship Arabic-first UX from power-on (bootloader) to desktop. English remains available as an optional debug fallback.

| Feature | Status | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Arabic Boot Experience (Stage 2)** | 📅 | Arabic splash/menu/messages in graphics mode (Mode 13h now, VBE later); must stay within Stage 2 size constraints and keep a reliable fallback path. |
| **Unicode Strategy (UTF-8 Everywhere)** | 📅 | Standardize on UTF-8 for kernel/userland/VFS; add safe UTF-8 primitives (decode/iterate/width). |
| **Framebuffer Terminal (Arabic Text Stack)** | 📅 | Primary console becomes framebuffer-rendered text with Arabic shaping + RTL; VGA text mode becomes compat/debug only. |
| **Arabic Shaping (v1)** | 📅 | Contextual forms + Lam-Alef; diacritics support staged. |
| **Bidi (v1)** | 📅 | Start with Arabic-only RTL lines, then support mixed Arabic+Latin+numbers runs with sane cursor behavior. |
| **Arabic Keyboard Layout** | 📅 | Scancode -> Unicode Arabic mapping, layout toggle, digit mode (Arabic-Indic vs Western). |
| **Arabic KShell & Base Tools** | 📅 | Commands, help, and system messages Arabic-first; keep English aliases for development. |
| **UTF-8 Filenames in VFS/PyFS** | 📅 | End-to-end UTF-8 path handling, directory entries, and a policy for normalization and sorting. |
| **GUI RTL + Arabic Text** | 📅 | GUI toolkit supports RTL layout mirroring and shaped/bidi text rendering everywhere. |
| **Baa + Takween Integration (Arabic-first DX)** | 📅 | Build PyramidOS with Baa/Takween and ship Arabic-first developer tooling and project schemas. |

**Detailed plan:** `docs/ROADMAP_ARABIC_FIRST.md`  
**Scheduling rule:** Arabic-first remains the identity, but advanced shaping/bidi/framebuffer work starts only after the v0.9 storage/memory gates in `docs/ROADMAP.md` pass.

## 1. 🛤️ Milestone 1: The Bootloader (PyramidBL)

**Goal:** Reliably load the kernel payload into memory and transition the CPU to a usable state.

| Feature | Status | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Legacy BIOS (Stage 1)** | ✅ | MBR, 512-byte limit, CHS/LBA disk reading. |
| **Legacy BIOS (Stage 2)** | ✅ | A20 enable, E820 memory map, Kernel Header parsing. |
| **Protected Mode Setup** | ✅ | GDT setup, 32-bit transition, jump to Kernel Entry. |
| **Bootloader UX (Tier 1: Text Mode Polish)** | ✅ | Stage 2 branded screen, consistent status lines, progress bar, boot menu; Stage 1 remains minimal for stability. |
| **Bootloader UX (Tier 2: Mode 13h Splash)** | ✅ | BIOS Mode 13h (320x200x256) splash + progress bar; hard fallback to text mode. |
| **Bootloader UX (Tier 3: VBE Splash / Installer UI)** | 🔮 | VBE high-res LFB splash and future “Blue Crystal” installer UI; robust fallback path required. |
| **UEFI Support** | 📅 | Modern UEFI bootloader (EDK2) loading from ESP. |
| **Multiboot Compliance** | 🔮 | Standard header for compatibility with GRUB/QEMU. |

## 2. 🧠 Milestone 2: Kernel Core Foundation

**Goal:** Establish control over the hardware resources (CPU, RAM, Interrupts).

| Feature | Status | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Kernel Entry** | ✅ | Stack setup, Environment cleanup, C Runtime handoff. |
| **Physical Memory (PMM)** | ⚠️ | Bitmap allocator and E820 parsing exist; v0.9 must harden reserved ranges and bitmap placement. |
| **Interrupts (IDT)** | ✅ | Exception handling (Page Faults, Div-by-zero) & Hardware IRQs. |
| **Virtual Memory (VMM)** | ⚠️ | Paging enabled with early mappings; higher-half/user isolation is planned, not complete. |
| **Hardware Interrupts** | ✅ | 8259 PIC Remapping, IRQ Masking/Unmasking. |
| **Kernel Heap** | ✅ | Dynamic memory (`kmalloc`/`kfree`) with coalescing and safety checks. |
| **Multitasking** | 📅 | Custom Process Control Blocks (PCB), Round-Robin Scheduler. |

## 3. ⌨️ Milestone 3: Interaction & Drivers (HAL)

**Goal:** Allow the user to interact with the system and persist data.

| Feature | Status | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Keyboard Driver** | ✅ | Scancode translation, Circular Buffer, Shift/Caps support. |
| **Text Shell (KShell)** | ✅ | Interactive CLI, Command parsing, History (Basic). |
| **Diagnostics (Selftest)** | ✅ | Boot-time + on-demand kernel diagnostics via KShell `diagnose` (PMM/Heap/ATA). |
| **RTC/CMOS** | ✅ | Real-Time Clock driver for system Date/Time. |
| **System Timer** | ✅ | PIT Driver (100Hz) for uptime and sleep (idle uses STI+HLT via `cpu_idle()`). |
| **Storage Drivers** | 🚧 | ATA/PIO driver (Read-Only): LBA28 PIO reads + IDENTIFY detection + safer polling/timeouts. |
| **Filesystem (VFS)** | 🚧 | VFS foundation: mount table + file descriptors + DevFS (`/dev`) exposure. |
| **Partition Discovery (MBR)** | 🚧 | Register `disk0p1..disk0p4` block devices for filesystem mounting. |
| **PyFS (Read-Only)** | 🚧 | Probe + mount PyFS on a partition device (e.g., `disk0p1`) before full RW+journaling. |
| **HAL Boundary Enforcement** | 📅 | Formalize stable HAL boundaries so Drivers don’t depend on Arch specifics (port I/O, IRQ wiring, paging internals). |

## 4. 📦 Milestone 4: Userland & Protected Execution
