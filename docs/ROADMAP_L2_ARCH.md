# Layer 2: Architectural Design (PyramidOS)

This document details the internal design of the kernel subsystems. It bridges the gap between the Strategic Roadmap (Layer 1) and the actual Code (Layer 3).

---

## 1. 🧠 Memory Management Architecture

### 1.1 Physical Memory Manager (PMM)

* **Algorithm:** Bitmap Allocator (Optimized with Next-Fit).
* **Granularity:** 4KiB Blocks (Frames).
* **Metadata Storage:** currently physical `0x00020000`; this is a v0.9 risk and must either be proven safe against `kernel_end` or moved dynamically.

### 1.2 Virtual Memory Manager (VMM)

* **Mechanism:** x86 Paging (CR3).
* **Architecture Goal (after v0.9/v0.10 groundwork): Higher-Half Kernel**
  * **User Space:** `0x00000000` to `0xBFFFFFFF` (3GB).
  * **Kernel Space:** `0xC0000000` to `0xFFFFFFFF` (1GB).
  * **Implementation:**
    * Linker eventually moves virtual symbols to `0xC0000000`.
    * Bootloader or early `entry.asm` maps high virtual kernel addresses to the chosen physical load region.
    * User access is prevented with supervisor-only page permissions; merely mapping higher-half is not enough without correct permissions and Ring 3 setup.

### 1.3 Kernel Heap

* **Goal:** Dynamic memory allocation (`kmalloc`/`kfree`).
* **Algorithm:** Doubly Linked List with Safety Canaries.
* **Location:** Placed in Kernel Space (e.g., starting at `0xD0000000`).

## 2. ⚡ Interrupt & Exception Model

### 2.1 Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)

* **Vector Assignment:** 0-31 (Exceptions), 32-47 (IRQs), 0x80 (Syscalls).
* **Handling Flow:** CPU -> ASM Stub -> C Handler -> Driver -> EOI -> IRET.

### 2.2 Task State Segment (TSS) - Required for Ring 3

* **Role:** The x86 CPU needs to know where the **Kernel Stack** is when an interrupt occurs inside a User App.
* **Implementation:**
  * One TSS entry in the GDT.
  * `ESP0` field updated by the Scheduler on every context switch.
  * Without this, a User Mode interrupt causes a Double Fault (Stack Fault).

## 3. 🔌 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

### 3.1 Input Subsystem

* **Keyboard:** PS/2 Scancode translation (Set 1) -> ASCII Buffer.
* **Mouse:** PS/2 Packet parsing (3-byte packets) -> Event Queue.

### 3.2 System Timer

* **PIT:** 8253/8254 (Channel 0, Mode 3) @ 100 Hz.
* **Usage:** Preemptive Scheduler quantum & System Uptime.
* **Power Model:** When waiting, the kernel uses a centralized idle primitive (`cpu_idle()` = `sti; hlt`) to avoid busy-waiting.

### 3.3 Storage (ATA/PIO)

* **Mode:** PIO (Programmed I/O) initially, DMA later.
* **Addressing:** LBA28 (28-bit Logical Block Addressing).
* **Current Implementation (v0.8.1+):**
  * Read-only LBA28 PIO path via `ata_read_sector(drive, lba, buffer)`.
  * IDENTIFY-based presence detection + master/slave probing to avoid phantom devices.
  * Exposed to the user via `diskread <lba>` in KShell and validated by the diagnostics ATA selftest.

### 3.4 HAL Boundary Enforcement (Planned)

* **Goal:** Keep the monolith structured and stable by preventing cross-layer coupling.
* **Policy:**
  * **Drivers** should depend on stable Core/HAL interfaces, not raw architecture details.
  * **Arch** owns CPU tables/port I/O primitives; Core provides safe wrappers where needed.
  * This boundary becomes critical as we introduce User Mode, syscalls, and a real VFS-backed userland.

## 4. 🔄 Process Management & Executable Format

### 4.1 Pyramid Executable Format (PXF)

* **Concept:** A lightweight, Pyramid-native executable container designed for fast parsing and sovereign evolution.
* **Hard Constraint:** PXF must not resemble ELF/PE conventions (no “sections”, “program headers”, or legacy loader semantics). It should feel like a Pyramid invention.
* **Design Direction (PXF Records):**
  * PXF is a **record-based container**: a small fixed header followed by a table of typed records.
  * Each record is a “Pyramid Region” (e.g., `CODE`, `DATA`, `BSS`, `IMPORTS`, `MANIFEST`, `SIGNATURE`).
  * The loader walks records and maps them according to permissions and alignment.
* **Proposed Structure:**

    ```c
    // PXF header: fixed + tiny.
    struct PXF_Header {
        uint32_t magic;         // 'PYRX' (0x58525950)
        uint32_t version;       // Format version
        uint32_t entry_point;   // Virtual address of entry
        uint32_t record_off;    // Offset to record table
        uint32_t record_count;  // Number of records
        uint32_t flags;         // Global flags (signed, pie, etc)
    };

    // Record: typed regions (not ELF segments, not PE sections).
    struct PXF_Record {
        uint32_t type;        // FourCC-like tag: 'CODE','DATA','BSS ','IMPT',...
        uint32_t perms;       // R/W/X bits (Pyramid-defined)
        uint32_t vaddr;       // Virtual destination
        uint32_t file_off;    // Payload offset (0 for BSS)
        uint32_t file_size;   // Bytes in file
        uint32_t mem_size;    // Bytes in memory (>= file_size)
        uint32_t align;       // Required alignment
    };
    ```

* **Loading Strategy:**
    1. Validate magic/version.
    2. Validate record table bounds (no overflow).
    3. For each record: VMM allocates/maps pages according to `vaddr`, `mem_size`, `align`, and `perms`.
    4. Copy payload (if any) and zero any tail (`mem_size - file_size`).
    5. Jump to `entry_point` (Ring 3).

### 4.2 Process Control Block (PCB)

* **Data:**
  * `pid`: Process ID.
  * `esp`: Kernel Stack Pointer.
  * `cr3`: Page Directory (Memory Context).
  * `state`: READY, RUNNING, BLOCKED, ZOMBIE.
  * `file_handles`: Array of open resource pointers.

### 4.3 Scheduler

* **Algorithm:** Round Robin (Time Slicing).
* **Context Switch:** Save registers -> Swap CR3 -> Swap ESP -> Restore registers.

## 5. 💾 Filesystem Architecture

### 5.1 Virtual File System (VFS)

* **Role:** Abstract interface for file operations (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`).
* **Mount Points:** Root `/` mapped to primary partition.
* **Current Implementation (v0.8.1+):**
  * Static mount table + FD table (`open/read/close`).
  * `/` mounted to a `nullfs` placeholder during bring-up.
  * `/dev` mounted to `devfs` (virtual devices as file nodes).
  * ATA exposed via a generic block-device registry as `disk0` (and optional `disk1`).
  * MBR scan registers `disk0p1..disk0p4` as partition block devices.
  * PyFS read-only probe can mount at `/py` for verification.

### 5.2 Pyramid File System (PyFS)

* **Design Goal:** A custom, journaled filesystem optimized for the kernel.
* **Phase 1 (Current):** Read-only bring-up with superblock probing on a partition device (e.g., `disk0p1`) and a verification read path (`/py/superblock`).
* **Planned Performance & Integrity Roadmap (Later Phases):**
  * **Extents (Early):** Move from block pointers to extents `(start_block, length)` to reduce metadata reads and accelerate sequential I/O.
  * **Directory Indexing:** Add B+Tree or hash indexing for directory entries to avoid O(N) scans as directories grow.
  * **Journaling Strategy:** Prefer **Copy-on-Write metadata + log** (snapshot-friendly, stable under crashes) over legacy full-data journaling.
  * **Checksums (PyCRC):** Introduce a Pyramid-native checksum system (“PyCRC”) for metadata (and optionally data). Use a modern, fast checksum algorithm internally, but expose it as PyCRC in PyramidOS.
  * **Superblock Redundancy:** Multiple superblock copies at fixed LBAs for recovery (with generation counters).
  * **Performance Caches:** Inode cache + dentry cache + readahead strategy once multitasking and memory pressure management mature.
* **Structure (Baseline):**
  * **Superblock:** FS Geometry and Magic.
  * **Inode Table:** Metadata (Permissions, Size, Block Pointers or Extents).
  * **Block Bitmap:** Allocation tracking.
  * **Data Blocks:** Raw content.
* *(Note: FAT32 support will be maintained for boot interoperability).*

## 6. ⚙️ Configuration Subsystem

### 6.1 Pyramid Configuration Database (PyDB)

* **Concept:** A custom, binary, hierarchical key-value store replacing text-based `.ini` files and the proprietary Windows Registry.
* **Current Concept Model:** Memory-mapped binary tree.
* **Planned Architecture (Later Phases):**
  * **Write Path (Log-Structured):** Append new records to a transaction log, then update an index (or rebuild index on boot if needed).
  * **Atomicity:** Explicit transaction begin/commit markers + checksum (PyCRC) to guarantee crash consistency.
  * **Compaction:** Background merge/compaction to keep lookups fast and reduce fragmentation.
  * **Access Model:** Namespaces + ACLs (kernel/user separation) once Ring 3 exists.
* **Node Structure (Conceptual):**

    ```c
    struct PyDB_Node {
        char name[32];
        uint8_t type;    // INT, STRING, BINARY, LIST
        uint32_t size;
        void* data;
        struct PyDB_Node* children;
        struct PyDB_Node* next;
    };
    ```

## 7. 🩺 System Integrity & Diagnostics (SID)

### 7.0 Console / Terminal

* **Current:** VGA Text Mode terminal driver (`kernel/drivers/terminal.c/.h`) used by the kernel core, shell, and panic paths.
* **Goal:** Keep console output behind a stable driver API to prevent cross-module `extern` coupling.

### 7.1 Power-On Self-Test (POST)
*   **Concept:** A dedicated boot-time routine that validates hardware and kernel subsystems before the Shell launches.
*   **Current Implementation (v0.8):**
    *   `kernel/core/selftest.c` provides `selftest_run_all()` and individual tests for PMM/Heap/ATA.
    *   Diagnostics run automatically at boot and are also available via the KShell command `diagnose`.
*   **Architecture (Next Iteration):**
    *   **Modular Tests:** Each subsystem exports a focused test function (PMM, VMM, ATA, Heap, etc).
    *   **The Check-Engine:** A master sequencer that can halt boot if a critical subsystem fails (Memory, Paging, Interrupts).
*   **Visual Feedback:** A dedicated status screen listing components:
    ```text
    [ OK ] Physical Memory Manager
    [ OK ] Virtual Memory Manager
    [FAIL] ATA Disk Controller (Error: Timeout)
    ```

### 7.2 Kernel Log Buffer (KLog)
*   **Goal:** Decouple debug messages from the screen.
*   **Mechanism:** `kprintf` writes to a circular memory buffer. A background task or shell command (`dmesg`) prints them to the screen later.

* **Persistence:** Serialized to `SYSTEM.PDB` on shutdown, loaded on boot.
